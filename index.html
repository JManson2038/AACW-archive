  <h2>Conjecture: What Is This Archive?</h2>
  <p>This digital photographic archive documents African American workers' involvement in Pittsburgh's building trades and the struggle to gain access to skilled union jobs. The archive primarily spans from the late 1950s through the 1980s, a period that is marked by intense civil rights events, labor realignment, and urban redevelopment. The photographs are housed and preserved by the University of Pittsburgh and made accessible through its digital collections platform. The images record apprenticeship programs, meetings with union leaders, civil rights protests, community organizing, and training initiatives such as those associated with Local 11.</p> 
  <p>To make sense of this archive, a reader needs to understand the historical context at this time. In the mid-20th century of Pittsburgh, trade unions controlled access to well-paying construction and infrastructure jobs. These unions often excluded African Americans through discriminatory apprenticeship standards. At the same time, the civil right movement was shifting its attention from public accommodation and voting rights to economic justice and employment access. Pittsburgh, like many industrial cities, became a focus point for desegregating the trades. The archive visualizes that fight, capturing both institutional resistance and activism. It also reflects the local history of organizations such as the Black Construction Coalition and NAACP labor that pressured unions and contractors to change.</p>
  <p>Now, people can browse the collection online through the University of Pittsburgh's digital collections portal. This platform includes captions, dates, names, subject tags, and items that identify people. These help researchers trace the history of activism and labor integration efforts across time.</p>

  <h2>Definition: What Is in the Archive?</h2>
  <p>This archive is a set of primary-source photographs held by the University of Pittsburgh. It is an organized collection that is structured into three volumes spanning from 1956 to 1987. In this archive are photographs of union life and membership, activism, demonstrations, community and civil-right moments.</p> 
  <p>The photographs were collected and preserved by the University as part of its effort to document the history of African American labor and civil rights in Pittsburgh. Each image has data like dates, names, subjects, and identifiers. The archive is structured into three volumes. The relationship to other information is that the archive sits at the crossroads of union records and newspaper accounts that discuss African American exclusion from skilled construction jobs.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Quality: Why This Archive Matters</h2>
  <p>The archive has the power to change how labor history is understood. The traditional labor narrative often highlights unions as defenders of working class people, yet they rarely address how those same institutions enforced racial boundaries. This archive shows the stories of those African American workers who fought for demanding access to middle class jobs.</p>
  <p>From the perspective of Foucauldian thought, the archive establishes what can be remembered and what remains invisible. It shows African American labor activism; the archive produces knowledge and questions the dominant narrative about unions. It also demonstrates the relationship between labor rights and civil rights. This archive also reveals exclusions: Black women's participation and involvement in organizing, non-unionized laborers, and undocumented workers are underrepresented. These exclusions raise questions about who controlled which stories were prioritized in the archive.</p> 
  <p>This archive has been used by historians of labor and civil rights. It also helps scholars writing on Pittsburgh's Black political economy or the history of steel towns often cite university-held photographic collections, public historians, and museums.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Policy: What Should Be Done with This Archive?</h2>
  <p>The archive has potential to challenge existing knowledge about labor unions. It connects to broader labor integration in cities like New York, Chicago, and Detroit, where similar clashes occurred. It focuses on unions fighting for workers' rights while simultaneously sustaining racial exclusion. Finally, I want to go back and look again at the absence of Black women in the visual record to find a reason why that is not in the archive. Were they active in the community mobilization behind the scenes? Did they appear in stories that were passed orally that weren't digitized? These questions show how archives can both reveal and conceal knowledge.</p>
